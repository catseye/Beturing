<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Beturing is a programming language based on a "universal" Turing machine
with an unbounded, 2-dimensional "tape".  (The Turing machine on which it is
based is "universal" in the sense that the machine's state transition diagram is
stored on the "tape" along with the data.)</p>

<h3>General Layout</h3>

<p>This 2-dimensional "tape" is where all the action happens; it is
called the <i>playfield</i> and is divided into discrete units called <i>cells</i>.
Each cell may store exactly one of a number of <i>symbols</i> drawn from
a finite alphabet.</p>

<p>There are two "heads" that access the playfield, one of which
(the <i>data head</i>) reads and alters the data (like in a common Turing machine,)
the other of which (the <i>code head</i>) reads the state transition diagram.</p>

<p>The state transition diagram is made up of <i>codes</i>.  Each code is a
2x2 block of cells in the following form:</p>

<center><table border=0 bgcolor=#e0e0e0>
<tr><td><tt>a</tt></td><td><tt>b</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>&gt;</tt></td><td><tt>/</tt></td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>The code head is considered to be over a code when it is over the upper-left cell of it.
The names and meanings of the four parts of the code are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The upper-left cell of a code contains a symbol to look for, called the <i>seek symbol</i>.
All symbols are valid seek symbols.</li>
<li>The upper-right cell of the code contains a symbol to replace it with, called the <i>replacement symbol</i>.
All symbols are valid replacement symbols.</li>
<li>The lower-left cell of the code contains an indication of how to move the data head, called
the <i>data head movement operator</i>.
The set of valid data head movement operators is
{<tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>^</tt>, <tt>v</tt>, <tt>.</tt>, <tt>*</tt>}.</li>
<li>The lower-right cell of the code contains an indication of what to do with the code head, called
the <i>state transition operator</i>.
The set of valid state transition operators is
{<tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>^</tt>, <tt>v</tt>,  <tt>/</tt>, <tt>@</tt>}.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>When a Beturing playfield is loaded from source such as a text file, lines are
translated to rows in the playfield.  The first line is loaded at (0, 0), and subsequent
lines are loaded at (0, 1), (0, 2), etc.  Lines which begin with a <tt>#</tt> are not
loaded into the playfield.  Certain lines that begin with <tt>#</tt>, listed below,
are directives meaningful to any Beturing interpreter.
The rest may have a local interpretation (such as the <tt>#!</tt> convention
on Unix systems,) or be ignored.  A line which begins with <tt>##</tt> is
guaranteed to be ignored.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lines of the form <tt># @(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</tt> where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
are integers reposition the loading of the text file; subsequent lines will be loaded into the playfield
at the given position.</li>
<li>Lines of the form <tt># C(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</tt> specify the initial position of
the code head.  The last such line is the one that takes effect.</li>
<li>Lines of the form <tt># D(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</tt> specify the initial position of
the data head.  The last such line is the one that takes effect.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Semantics</h3>

<p>When a Beturing machine is set in motion, it <i>interprets</i> the code under the code head,
transitions to a new state by moving the code head, then
repeats indefinitely until the machine enters the <i>halt</i> state.</p>

<p>Here is how each code is interpreted:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the data head movement operator is the special symbol <tt>*</tt>, the following things happen:
  <ul>
  <li>The code head is moved by the positive interpretation (x2) of the state transition operator.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the symbol under the data head matches the seek symbol, the following things
happen:
  <ul>
  <li>The replacement symbol is written to the cell under the data head.</li>
  <li>The data head is moved by the positive interpretation of the data head movement operator.</li>
  <li>The code head is moved by the positive interpretation (x2) of the state transition operator.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Otherwise the symbol under the data head does <b>not</b> match the
seek symbol, and the following things happen:
  <ul>
  <li>The code head is moved by the negative interpretation (x2) of the state transition operator.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The positive and negative interpretations of the data head movement and state transition
operators are given below:</p>

<center><table border=1>
<tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Positive interpretation</th><th>Negative interpretation</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>&gt;</tt></td><td>Move right</td><td>Move right</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>&lt;</tt></td><td>Move left</td><td>Move left</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>^</tt></td><td>Move up</td><td>Move up</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>v</tt></td><td>Move down</td><td>Move down</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>.</tt></td><td>Don't move</td><td>Don't move</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>/</tt></td><td>Move right</td><td>Move down</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>@</tt></td><td>Halt</td><td>Halt</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Note that "x2" in the rules given above means to advance two cells in the given direction;
this is used everywhere for moving the code head because codes are 2x2 cell blocks.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>The Beturing language was designed (in part) as a test of the wire-crossing problem,
in the following manner.</p>

<p>Note that the code head does not have "direction" or "delta" state as the instruction
pointer does in Befunge; it has only "position" state.  Its next position (and thus the machine's
next state) is determined entirely by the state transition operator of the current code.</p>

<p>Note also that there is no "leap over" state transition operator (like <tt>#</tt> in Befunge.)
Therefore the next state must always be reachable by a continuous, unbroken
path through the playfield.</p>

<p>This means that a Beturing machine is incapable of having a state transition diagram
that, when rendered on a 2-dimensional plane, requires that two edges cross.
(A state diagram with, e.g., 5 states, and a transition from each state to every other state, appears
to have this property (although it would be nice to have a reference to a watertight proof of this...))</p>

<p>This <b>might</b> mean that it is impossible to construct a
true universal Turing machine in Beturing, <i>if</i> a  universal Turing machine
requires a state diagram which has edges that cross when rendered in two dimensions.</p>

<p>If this were the case (and it may well be) then Beturing would not be Turing-complete,
and in fact its level of computational power would probably be difficult to determine.</p>
